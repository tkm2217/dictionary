Ankylosaurus
Ankylosaurus is a genus of armored dinosaur. Its fossils have been found in geological formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period, about 68â€“66 million years ago, in western North America, making it among the last of the non-avian dinosaurs.

Janenschia
Janenschia is a large herbivorous sauropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania, Africa, 155 million years ago.Janenschia (named after Werner Janensch) was a giant plant-eating dinosaur. This enormous dinosaur had a long neck, and a long tail. It was about 80 feet (24 m) long and weighed about 33 tons (30000 kg).

Allosaurus
It is a genus of large carnosauria theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 145 million years ago during the Late Jurassic epoch. The name "Allosaurus" means "different lizard" alluding to its unique concave vertebrae. The brain of Allosaurus, as interpreted from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was more consistent with crocodilian brains than those of the other living archosaurs, birds.

Stegosaurus
Stegosaurus is a genus of herbivorous, four-legged, thyreophorans from the Late Jurassic, characterized by the distinctive kite-shaped upright plates along their backs and spikes on their tails. It had a large gut to break down the plants it ate. Stegosaurus was most probably prey for the likes of Allosaurus, Torvosaurus, and maybe even smaller meat eaters.

Diplodocus
Diplodocus is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaurs, whose fossils were first discovered in 1877 by S. W. Williston. Camarasaurus' skull and jaw were adapted to accommodate high stresses, allowing it to eat tough leaves and branches. Diplodocus, on the other hand, was more suited to eating ferns and stripping soft leaves off trees.

Spinosaurus
Genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived throughout what now is North Africa during Cenomanian to Upper Turonian stages of the Late Cretaceous period. Spinosaurus is known to have eaten fish, and most scientists believe that it hunted both terrestrial and aquatic prey. The original remains were destroyed in World War II, but additional material has come to light in the early 21st century. It is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the scientific literature.

Gallimimus
It is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now Mongolia during the Late Cretaceous period, about seventy million years agoGallimimus was one of the best-known dinosaurs from a group called ornithomimids. They were also just as quick on their feet, and the fastest of all dinosaurs, capable of running at speeds of perhaps 80kph (50mph).

Styracosaurus
Styracosaurus is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period, about 75.5 to 75 million years ago.Styracosaurus in game's files Carnivores 2 In Primal Prey, the Styracosaurus is available to hunt early on, and is the first dangerous herbivore available to hunt (chronologically). They almost always travel in herds unless wounded, and the herds have a nasty habit of gathering around the entry portal.

Triceratops
An extinct genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago in what is now North America. Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the most well-known ceratopsid. It was also one of the largest, up to 9 meters (30 ft) long and 12 metric tons (13 short tons) in weight.

Velociraptor
This dinosaur lived during later part of the Cretaceosus Preiod.It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and tear into prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout.

Brachiosaurus
Commonly lived in North America during the Late Jurassic about 152-153 million years ago. It was found to be a warm-blooded animal through research. One of the largest dinosaurs.It was believed throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that sauropods like Brachiosaurus were too massive to support their own weight on dry land, and instead lived partly submerged in water.

Pachycephalosaurus
A herbivorous creature which is primarily known from a single skull and a few extremely thick skull roofs, at 9 inches thick.It lived during the Late Cretaceous Period (Maastrichtian stage) of what is now North America. Remains have been excavated in Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming and Alberta.Pachycephalosaurus was a bipedal herbivore with an extremely thick skull roof. It possessed long hindlimbs and small forelimbs.

Mamenchisaurus
Mamenchisaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur known for their remarkably long necks which made up nearly half the total body length. Numerous species have been assigned to the genus; however, many of these might be questionable. Fossils have been found in the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan Province in China.
3
Tyrannosaurus
Tyrannosaurus is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex, often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented of these large theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.

Dreadnoughtus
One of the largest titanosaurs, possibly the largest according to some sources, was Dreadnoughtus. It had a total length of roughly 26 meters (about 85 feet) and an estimated mass of 59 metric tons (about 65 tons). Dreadnoughtus is known from rock deposits of southern Patagonia, Argentina, that date to about 77 million years ago.
